# 1Retro Documentation

Source for [docs.1retro.com](https://docs.1retro.com): 1Retro's specifications and product documentation, in one place.

This is an open repository.
Specs and guides are written in Markdown so anyone can read them on GitHub or propose a change without running the full site.

## What lives here

- **Specifications**: the formats and protocols behind 1Retro, written to be implemented by anyone.
  The first is the Universal Saves Format (`.saves` / `1SAV`); the 1Forge save-parser system and others follow.
- **Guides & product docs**: how to use 1Retro across platforms (web, desktop, CLI, MiSTer, OnionOS, and friends).

Content lives under `src/content/docs/`, split into `specifications/` and `guides/`.
The sidebar is generated from those directories, so adding a page is just adding a Markdown file.

## Local development

The site is built with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).
You need a current Node.js LTS (20 or 22).

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the dev server on [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321), with live reload:

```sh
npm start
```

Build the static site into `./dist`:

```sh
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally before deploying:

```sh
npm run preview
```

You do not need any of this to edit prose.
Markdown changes can be made and reviewed directly on GitHub.
